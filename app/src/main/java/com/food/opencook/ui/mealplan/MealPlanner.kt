/**
 * Pure meal-plan scoring — no Android/Room/IO, so it's directly unit-testable.
 *
 * [generateWeek] fills the free (non-skipped, non-pinned) days greedily, each day
 * picking the highest-scoring recipe. The score balances **variety** (penalise
 * recently-planned recipes and the same category as a neighbouring day) against
 * **shoppability** (reward reusing ingredients already in the week, penalise each
 * new ingredient the recipe forces onto the shopping list), with small nudges
 * for time-fit (quicker on weekdays) and pantry coverage, plus seeded jitter so
 * "re-roll" yields a different — but still good — plan. A big-batch recipe
 * (servings ≥ 2× household) is also placed on the next free day as leftovers.
 *
 * Staples (salt, pepper, oil, broth, …) are filtered out before reuse/cardinality
 * are measured — see [IngredientStaples] — so "salt in Mon + Wed" stops dominating
 * the reuse signal.
 *
 * The result carries a [PickedRecipe] per day with the per-factor score
 * breakdown so the UI can explain *why* a dish was chosen instead of just
 * surfacing a recipe id.
