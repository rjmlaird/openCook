/**
 * Coarse "what's the main protein" classifier for the meal planner's variety scoring — so
 * three chicken dishes in one week read as monotonous even when their side ingredients differ.
 *
 * Keyword substring match (like [GroceryCategories]). The keyword lists live in the per-locale
 * arrays.xml resources (`protein_kw_*`) and are loaded by `LocalizedLists` as the **union across
 * every bundled content language**, so classification is content-language independent (an
 * English-locale device with German recipes still groups "Hähnchen" as poultry) and a newly
 * translated language grows the lists without touching this file. The canonical group keys stay
 * fixed internal identifiers (also shown, title-cased, in the meal-plan reason). Deliberately
 * heuristic: a wrong grouping only nudges a soft variety penalty, never excludes a recipe.
 *
 * The hardcoded DE+EN default keeps unit tests (and a not-yet-initialized process) working before
 * `LocalizedLists` swaps in the resource-backed lists.
