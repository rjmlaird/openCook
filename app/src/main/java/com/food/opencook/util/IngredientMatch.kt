 * Plural/singular-aware ingredient-name matching for pantry coverage, ingredient reuse
 * (shoppability), the "missing items" badge and shopping-list pantry skipping.
 *
 * Purely a comparison **predicate** — it never rewrites stored names; "Zwiebeln" and
 * "Zwiebel" simply compare equal. Handles German plural suffixes AND single-word
 * compound-noun heads ("Mehl" ↔ "Weizenmehl").
 *
 * For pantry-vs-recipe coverage use [covers] (asymmetric): a generic pantry noun
 * covers a more specific recipe ingredient ("Pfeffer" covers "schwarzer Pfeffer"),
 * but not the other way around — being specific in the pantry doesn't satisfy a
 * generic recipe request. Use [matches] (symmetric) for "are these the same item?".
